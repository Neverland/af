# CLI for Cloud Foundry (compatible with next generation also known as v2)

The CLI for Cloud Foundry is being completely rewritten. Installation, usage & contribution instructions are below.

To use this CLI, your Cloud Foundry installation can be either running the v1 cloud controller or <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng">cloud_controller_ng</a>, which is a part of the latest <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/tree/master/jobs/cloud_controller_ng">cf-release</a>.

Some features, notably the ones using the v2 api, require cloud_controller_ng.

## Installation

```
$ gem install vmc
$ vmc -v
vmc 0.4.2
```

## Development

```
$ git clone git@github.com:cloudfoundry/vmc.git
